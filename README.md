# Debt-Collection
A simple Debt Collection (Vasooli) manager created using the Flask framework.
An employee of a debt collection agency will login to this application and will manually create new records of people given debts by loan sharks.
They will update the records daily in case a payment is made by the borrower. 
After a debt has been paid in full, the record will be deleted!
